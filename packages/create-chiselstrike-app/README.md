# Create ChiselStrike App

The quickest way to get started with ChiselStrike is to use the following
command to create a ChiselStrike-powered backend application with `npx`:

```console
npx create-chiselstrike-app hello-world
```

or with `yarn`:

```console
yarn create chiselstrike-app hello-world
```

The command creates a new ChiselStrike project in the 'hello-world' directory
and downloads the necessary dependencies, including the ChiselStrike CLI.

Once you have created a project, you can launch the backend with:

```console
npm run dev
```

Please see the [ChiselStrike documentation](https://docs.chiselstrike.com) for
more information on how to use ChiselStrike.
