# Getting Started

In this introductory ChiselStrike tutorial, we'll show how to build some simple
endpoints for your data-driven web applications. Along the sidebar at your left,
you'll see more advanced topics  you can explore as you are interested in them.

ChiselStrike comes in two parts - the backend generator `chisel` (available in npm) and
our service platform for hosting ChiselStrike data apps in production.

This tutorial will show you how to use `chisel`, which allows for easy local
development and testing.

Imagine you're just starting out building a new application for a dynamic site, but you don't want
to bother implementing an entire backend server, configuring a SQL database, and all
of that.

A particular example might involve building a blog that allows readers to make comments. 
Even if a blog was statically rendered, the comment section would need some kind of endpoint
to make it work.

If we had such and endpoint right now, we could interact with it via
`curl`, like this:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

# Setup

Let's get started by using ChiselStrike to create a skeleton of a backend project. This
step will also install all our dependendicies.

```bash
npx create-chiselstrike-app my-backend
```

Output will look something like this:

```console
Creating a new ChiselStrike project in my-backend ...
Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.

added 25 packages, and audited 26 packages in 8s

3 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

You can then start ChiselStrike in local development mode by running ChiselStrike in a new
terminal tab. As ChiselStrike runs, it will compile your work automatically as you
make changes, and it is also hosting your endpoints at the same time.

```bash
cd my-backend
npm run dev
```

You will see output like this:

```
> hello@1.0.0 dev
> chisel dev

## Our First Endpoint

To make our endpoint for "/dev/comments", we add a TypeScript file
in the `my-backend/endpoints` directory.  Here is one:

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments.ts"
import { responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api"

export default function chisel(_req) {
    return responseFromJson("Comments go here!");
}
```

Once you save this file, you'll see output in the `chisel dev`
output:

```
End point defined: /dev/comments
```

That's all it takes to define an endpoint!  It is now ready for use,
which you can check with `curl`:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and should see the following output:

```
"Comments go here!"
```

In the next step, we'll make our endpoint connect to some data.

What happened in the above example? The first
thing you'll notice is that the endpoint file `comments.ts` exports a function named `chisel` with
a single parameter.  This function defines the logic for the endpoint.  It takes a
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
and returns the corresponding
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
In this above example, we simply returns a string wrapped as a JSON value.  It
uses a helper function `responseFromJson`.

## Our First Model

Next, let's add the ability to save and load comments. We need to define what types of data we are going to save and load.

This is where backend models come in -- models use typescript to describe
what kind of data you want to store.  

Create a file in `my-backend/models/models.ts`:

```typescript title="my-backend/models/models.ts"
import { ChiselEntity } from "@chiselstrike/api"

export class BlogComment extends ChiselEntity {
    content: string = "";
    by: string = "";
}
```

Here we have defined a `BlogComment` which has a string `content` and an author name `by`.

<!-- FIXME: Move this to some advanced tips and tricks section, probably, to not distract from the tutorial? -->

:::tip
Since we're using TypeScript, you may have some questions about type checking. By default, `chisel` doesn't check your TypeScript types (we assume your IDE did that for you!), which results
in faster production code. If you want type checking, you can enable it by calling `tsc` directly, which can
be achieved by passing the `--type-check` option to `npm run dev`, or to the apply command `npx chisel apply`
:::

<!-- FIXME: move this into the data access chapter talking more about all the model capabilities -->

:::tip
You are able to specify default values for fields, like you would for a normal typescript
class. Properties can be added or removed over time if they have default values, so it is always recommended
you add them.
:::

Once you save this file, you should see new output from the `chisel dev` command that remains running to
compile your work and serve up your endpoints:

```
Model defined: BlogComment
```

Now you are able to store `BlogComment` objects!  However, we still need to surface those entities in our web-services API.  
That comes next!

# Our First Endpoint 

We're big fans of [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), but don't strictly require it in ChiselStrike.

If you're not familiar, REST is a set of practices that describes how an endpoint can handle various HTTP verbs
to provide ways to manipulate a collection of entities: create, read,
update, and delete ([CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)).

ChiselStrike makes REST as easy as it gets. To generate a REST collection for BlogComment, including a `POST` method
so we can add comments to the database, we can create the following endpoints file:

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments.ts"
import { BlogComment } from "../models/models";
export default BlogComment.crud();
```

Wow that was short! After saving this file, there will be an endpoint in ChiselStrike
for us to try out!

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "First comment", "by": "Jill"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Second comment", "by": "Jack"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Third comment", "by": "Jim"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Fourth comment", "by": "Jack"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Wrong comment", "by": "Author"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
```


Each POST will return a response to the caller with the object ID, for example:

```json
{"id":"a4ca3ab3-2e26-4da6-a5de-418c1e6b9b83","content":"First comment","by":"Jill"}
```
:::tip
Note how you do not need to specify an `id` for the `BlogComment` entity. An `id` property is automatically generated for you on all objects.
We always use UUIDs rather than integers.
:::

:::tip
Right now you are testing only locally, but you'll want to think about restricting access to some endpoints in production.  
We'll talk about security more in the [Policy](pol) section.
:::

Now that we've inserted some objects, lets read them back! Our `crud` function also registers a `GET` handler, which is already available!


```bash
curl localhost:8080/dev/comments | python -m json.tool
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a4ca3ab3-2e26-4da6-a5de-418c1e6b9b83",
    "content": "First comment",
    "by": "Jill"
  },
  {
    "id": "fed312d7-b36b-4f34-bb04-fba327a3f440",
    "content": "Second comment",
    "by": "Jack"
  },
  {
    "id": "adc89862-dfaa-43ab-a639-477111afc55e",
    "content": "Third comment",
    "by": "Jim"
  },
  {
    "id": "5bfef47e-371b-44e8-a2dd-88260b5c3f2c",
    "content": "Fourth comment",
    "by": "Jack"
  },
  {
    "id": "d419e629-4304-44d5-b534-9ce446f25e9d",
    "content": "Wrong comment",
    "by": "Author"
  }
]
```

...note:
Obviously, If you had 10,000 blog responses you wouldn't want to return them all at once.
Pagination support for collections of large objects will be coming very soon!
...

To get a specific comment, we can just specify an id:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/dev/comments/a4ca3ab3-2e26-4da6-a5de-418c1e6b9b83 | python -m json.tool
```

```json
{
  "id": "a4ca3ab3-2e26-4da6-a5de-418c1e6b9b83",
  "content": "First comment",
  "by": "Jill"
}
```

# Built-In Search

The API also allows you to filter by specific properties, by specifying a search parameter with a partial URL-encoded JSON object:

```bash
curl -g localhost:8080/dev/comments?f={%22by%22:%22Jack%22} | python -m json.tool
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "fed312d7-b36b-4f34-bb04-fba327a3f440",
    "content": "Second comment",
    "by": "Jack"
  },
  {
    "id": "5bfef47e-371b-44e8-a2dd-88260b5c3f2c",
    "content": "Fourth comment",
    "by": "Jack"
  }
]
```

# PUT and DELETE

We can also amend an object with `PUT`:

```
curl -X PUT -d '{"content": "Right Comment", "by": "Right Author"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments/d419e629-4304-44d5-b534-9ce446f25e9d
```

<!-- FIXME: add an example about PATCH? -->

and ultimately `DELETE` it:

```
curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/dev/comments/d419e629-4304-44d5-b534-9ce446f25e9d
```

# Customizing CRUD Further

<!-- FIXME: move into extra chapter? -->

CRUD generation is customizable; more detail around this and also security policy is coming soon but 
here is a lower-level example that forbids DELETE, POST, and PUT while wrapping the GET result 
with either `{"data": VALUE}` or `{"error": "message"}` depending on the result.

<!-- FIXME: replace with class based alternates once available -->

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments-readonly.ts"
import { crud, standardCRUDMethods, responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api";
import { BlogComment } from "../models/models";
export default crud(
    BlogComment,
    ":id", /* :id can be explicitly provided */
    {
        customMethods: {
            DELETE: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
            POST: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
            PUT: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
        },
        createResponses: {
            GET: (body: unknown, status: number) => {
                if (status < 400) {
                    return responseFromJson({ data: body }, status);
                }
                return responseFromJson({ error: body }, status);
            },
        }
    },
);
```

## Fully Custom Endpoints

<!-- FIXME: move into extra chapter -->

Being able to just get started very quickly and spawn a CRUD API is great, but as your
project evolves in complexity you may find yourself needing custom business logic and endpoints
that don't fit neatly into REST workflows.

ChiselStrike allows each `endpoint` file to export a default method that takes a [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
object as a parameter, and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). You can then add whatever logic you want.

This is a lower level mechanism and is pretty raw -- we are working on syntax features that will make this much more powerful.

:::tip
You can't change data during a `GET` request. Make sure that if you are making changes to the backend state,
they happen under `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`!
:::

Now let's edit our endpoint's code to show off a "full customization" example.

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments.ts"
import { responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api"
import { BlogComment } from "../models/models"

export default async function chisel(req) {

    if (req.method == 'POST') {
        const payload = await req.json();
        const by = payload["by"] || "anonymous";
        const created = BlogComment.build({'content': payload['content'], 'by': by });
        await created.save();
        return responseFromJson(created);
    }

    else if (req.method == 'GET') {
        const tokens = req.url.split('/')
        // better syntax around this coming soon!
        if (tokens.length != 6) {
           const comments = await BlogComment.cursor().toArray();
           return responseFromJson(comments);
        } else {
           const id = tokens.reverse()[0]
           const comment = await BlogComment.findOne({id})
           if (comment) {
              return responseFromJson(comment)
           }
           return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
        }
    }

    else {
        return new Response("Wrong method", { status: 405 });
    }
}

```

:::tip
Remember how we didn't have to specify an `id` in the model? We can now access it
as `created.id` in the example above. If the object doesn't have an `id`, one is created for you after
`save`. 
:::

:::tip
Notice that right now using the API to access objects that do not exist returns null values, rather
than raising exceptions. This will change in the near future, though right now we do our own explicit
error checking in the examples.
:::

With this endpoint example, we're now getting to know ChiselStrike's API and runtime better. Notice how
we were able to parse the request under `POST` with our own custom validation, and then use
the `build` API to construct an object that is then persisted with `save`.  We'll explain the use of the 
data model more in [Data Access](data-access).

Finally, notice how we can return a standard `Response` in some cases, but also can also use the convenience method
`responseFromJson` where we know the result is a JSON object.

Let's now test our endpoint with a POST, and see it works similarly to the automatic "CRUD" example above.

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Fifth comment", "by": "Jill"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and `curl` should return something like:

```console
{"id":"7190f1c5-7b81-4180-9db5-2d9c6ce17d6d","content":"Fifth comment","by":"Jill"}
```

Now lets fetch the entire list of comments:


```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/dev/comments | python -m json.tool
```

and we should see something like the following:

```json
[
    {
        "content": "First comment",
        "by": "Jill"
    },
    {
        "content": "Second comment",
        "by": "Jack"
    },
    {
        "content": "Third comment",
        "by": "Jim"
    },
    {
        "content": "Fourth comment",
        "by": "Jack"
    },
    {
        "content": "Fifth comment",
        "by": "Jill"
    }
]
```

(We've left off the UUIDs above)


üéâ Ta-da! You're a pro now! From generating a simple CRUD RESTful API, to a custom endpoint that behaves
exactly how you need it to, you've now learned a large chunk of the ChiselStrike platform!

## Additional Notes on File-based routing

<!-- FIXME: move this possibly to a topic page on routing or advanced topics catchall, "Ta-da" should finish out this chapter -->

Like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/creating-routes/#define-routes-in-srcpages) and
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#nested-routes), ChiselStrike routes incoming requests by
matching the URL path against the endpoint-code path.  When you create a file `endpoints/posts.ts`, the URL
`/dev/posts` invokes it.  When you create a file `endpoints/new/york/city.ts`, the URL `/dev/new/york/city`
invokes it.  But what happens when there is no exact match?  In that case, ChiselStrike uses the longest
prefix of the URL path that matches an existing endpoint definition.  In the previous example, the URL
`/dev/new/york/city/manhattan/downtown` will also be handled by `endpoints/new/york/city.ts` (assuming no
other endpoints).

This routing procedure helps the RESTful API work correctly.  For example, the above endpoint
`my-backend/endpoints/comments.ts` will be invoked when you access a specific comment, eg, at
`/dev/comments/1234-abcd-5678-efgh`.  The `BlogComment.crud()` will parse the URL and understand that a single
collection element is being accessed.
