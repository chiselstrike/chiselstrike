# NextJS

As Vercel themselves describe it, [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

We have an early example of a minimal NextJS project that shows how NextJS can easily talk to ChiselStrike.

This example will be updated over time to show off more and more features.  When using the ChiselStrike platform, you can deploy the frontend on Vercel while
we host the backend.
