# More About Endpoints

In this section we'll show how to move beyond simple CRUD requests, as shown in [Getting Started](Intro/first.md).

# Customizing CRUD Further

<!-- FIXME: move into extra chapter? -->

CRUD generation is customizable; more detail and syntax around this and also security policy is coming soon but
here is a lower-level example that forbids DELETE, POST, and PUT while wrapping the GET result
with either `{"data": VALUE}` or `{"error": "message"}` depending on the result.

<!-- FIXME: replace with class based alternates once available -->

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments-readonly.ts"
import { crud, standardCRUDMethods, responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api";
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment.ts";
export default crud(
    BlogComment,
    ":id", /* :id can be explicitly provided */
    {
        customMethods: {
            DELETE: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
            POST: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
            PUT: standardCRUDMethods.methodNotAllowed,
        },
        createResponses: {
            GET: (body: unknown, status: number) => {
                if (status < 400) {
                    return responseFromJson({ data: body["results"] }, status);
                }
                return responseFromJson({ error: body }, status);
            },
        }
    },
);
```

## Full Custom Endpoints

Being able to just get started very quickly and spawn a CRUD API is great, but as your
project evolves in complexity you may find yourself needing custom business logic and endpoints
that don't fit neatly into REST workflows.

ChiselStrike allows each `endpoint` file to export a default method that takes a `ChiselRequest`, a subclass of [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) with a few convenience fields added, as a parameter,
and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). You can then add whatever logic you want.

This is a lower level mechanism and is pretty raw -- we are working on syntax features that will make this much more powerful.

:::tip
You can't change data during a `GET` request. Make sure that if you are making changes to the backend state,
they happen under `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`!
:::

Now let's edit our endpoint's code to show off a "full customization" example.

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/comments.ts"
import { responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api"
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment.ts"

export default async function chisel(req: ChiselRequest) {
    if (req.method == 'POST') {
        const payload = await req.json();
        const by = payload["by"] || "anonymous";
        const content = payload["content"];
        const created = await BlogComment.create({ content, by });
        return responseFromJson(created);
    } else if (req.method == 'GET') {
        // if we have a parameter, treat it as an id, otherwise get all
        const id = req.pathComponents()[0]
        if (id) {
           const comment = await BlogComment.findOne({id})
           const status = comment ? 200 : 404;
           return responseFromJson(comment, status)
        } else {
           const comments = await BlogComment.cursor().toArray();
           return responseFromJson(comments);
        }
    } else {
        return new Response("Wrong method", { status: 405});
    }
}
```

:::tip
Remember how we didn't have to specify an `id` in the model? We can now access it
as `created.id` in the example above. If the object doesn't have an `id`, one is created for you after
`create` or `save`.
:::

:::tip
Notice that right now using `findOne` to access an object that does not exist returns a null value, rather
than raising an error. This may change in the near future. We do our own explicit
error checking in this example.
:::

With this endpoint example, we're now getting to know ChiselStrike's API and runtime better. Notice how
we were able to parse the request under `POST` with our own custom validation, and then use
the `build` API to construct an object that is then persisted with `save`.  We'll explain the use of the
data model more in [Data Access](Intro/data-access).

Finally, notice how we can return a standard `Response` in some cases, but also can also use the convenience method
`responseFromJson` where we know the result is a JSON object.

Let's now test our endpoint with a POST, and see it works similarly to the automatic "CRUD" example above.

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Fifth comment", "by": "Jill"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and `curl` should return something like:

```console
{"id":"7190f1c5-7b81-4180-9db5-2d9c6ce17d6d","content":"Fifth comment","by":"Jill"}
```

Now lets fetch the entire list of comments:


```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and we should see something like the following:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "First comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        },
        {
            "content": "Second comment",
            "by": "Jack"
        },
        {
            "content": "Third comment",
            "by": "Jim"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fourth comment",
            "by": "Jack"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fifth comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        }
    ]
}
```


ðŸŽ‰ Nice! You've gone from a simple REST API for learning how to write full custom endpoints using the full data model.
It's time to explore our API in greater depth, then you can set out and explore other documentation sections according
to your interests!

## Code sharing between endpoints

It is common for endpoints to share more code than just the models. If
the common code is already published as module, the module can be
imported directly:

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/indented.ts"
import indent from 'https://deno.land/x/text_indent@v0.1.0/mod.ts';

export default async function chisel(req: Request) {
    return new Response("the following is indented" + indent("foo", 16));
}
```

But for code that is specific to a project and not publicly available,
the module can be placed in a directory next to the endpoints. By
convention that directory is named lib, but any other name would
work. For example:

```typescript title="my-backend/lib/hello.ts"
export function hello() {
    return "Welcome to ChiselStrike";
}
```

```typescript title="my-backend/endpoints/day.ts"
import { hello } from "../lib/hello.ts";

export default async function (req: Request) {
    const msg = hello();
    return new Response(`${msg}\n Have a nice day.`);
}
```

## CRUD paging

Most of the examples we have used so far used rather small datasets. In the real world, datasets tend
to grow rather quickly and, for example, we can easily imagine storing thousands of comments.
Retrieving them all at once would be inefficient and usually unnecessary. That's where CRUD's
built-in paging comes into play.

The default page size is set to be 1000 elements. Let's restrict that a bit more to see how it works:

```bash
curl -g localhost:8080/dev/comments?sort=by&.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2
```

which gives us

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "First comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fifth comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        }
    ],
    "next_page": "localhost:8080/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=eyJheGV..."
}
```

Apparently, we got a new entry in the response - `next_page`. This is a link that will take us to the
next page of results. You can notice that the `sort` parameter is gone. That is because it's now
embedded in a new parameter `cursor` in which we encoded how to get to the next page. While you can't
modify the sort, you can freely modify other parameters like filtering or page size.

Based on the parameters, the **cursor will ensure that you will only get entities that come after the
last element on the current page**. This is a very useful property as it makes sure that you don't
get duplicate elements if insertion happens when transitioning between pages (similarly for deletions).

So let's continue and follow the next_page link:

```bash
curl -g localhost:8080/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=eyJheGV...
```

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "Third comment",
            "by": "Jim"
        },
    ],
    "prev_page": "localhost:8080/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=GVzIjpe..."
}
```

This gives us the reminder of the results as well as a link to the previous page that would take us
back where we came from. Similarly to the next page situation, the `cursor` parameter in this case
ensures that you will get elements that come before the first element of current page, in current
sort.

### Why cursor-based paging?

Compared to the classical offset-based paging, cursor paging has two main benefits.

First big advantage is that cursor-based paging is **stable**. This means that if you do insertions
resp. deletions while transitioning between pages, you won't miss entries resp. won't get duplicates.
Those problems can be very annoying to deal with.

Second advantage is **efficiency**. Paging using the standard offset approach can be very inefficient
when filters are used. The reason for this is that the database needs to go through all candidate
rows and apply the filter until it finds offset-number of valid entries and only then it starts
filling the page.

Cursor-based paging on the other hand leverages the user-specified sort (primary key sorting is used
if no sort is specified) and uses the elements as pivots. This way we can directly jump to the pivot
using index and start filling the page from there.

### HOST header

To construct the next/prev page links, we need to know what host and possibly port to use. It's not
trivial to retrieve it automatically due to proxies etc., hence we utilize the `HOST` HTTP header
from your request. For example `curl` sets it automatically and many HTTP libraries do the same.

If `HOST` header is not specified, we will try to guess it, but it's highly recomended that it's
provided.
