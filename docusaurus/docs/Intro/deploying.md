# Deploying

After you have created a ChiselStrike project and pushed it to a GitHub repository, you can deploy your project to the ChiselStrike platform in few easy steps.

First, [sign up](https://www.chiselstrike.com/login) to ChiselStrike with your GitHub account.

Then, create a [new project](https://www.chiselstrike.com/dashboard/new-project) and select a GitHub repository to import.

You now have deployed your project on ChiselStrike! To deploy a new version, just use `git push` to your GitHub repository, and the ChiselStrike platform will do the rest.
