# Welcome to ChiselStrike!

It's a pleasure to have you as part of our beta! Although
ChiselStrike is in its early stages, we hope you will already find it very
useful for a variety of your use cases.

The goal of this beta is to make sure we're building the right experience
for you. With this documentation, you will learn how to install ChiselStrike
and how to build a backend locally on your laptop.
It even works totally offline (how cool is that!! ðŸ¤©). You can integrate it with Gatsby,
Next.js, or any other framework.

Over the next few weeks, after the first round of feedback, we'll also allow you to deploy
it directly on our infrastructure from your git repository (and don't worry about ðŸ’°, it's
on us!).
