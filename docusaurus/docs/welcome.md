# Welcome to ChiselStrike!

We're so happy you're here! Chiselstrike is a new platform for developing and hosting data services.

If you want to get a new frontend working with real data in production, ChiselStrike is going to be the fastest way.

All apps need to work with data, but building services around them often involves crafting tedious boilerplate
code, pondering schema design, query optimization, laying out repetitive tedious server side business logic, and more. 
All of this gets in the way of building a compelling user-focused application and getting it out the door. 

With ChiselStrike, we enable you to remove complexity of "full stack" development, by creating your entire persistent layer 
(database, APIs, authentication) from simple TypeScript models and doing lots of heavy lifting for you. 
As a developer, you're off flying quickly, with half the code or less, and can devote most of your time to building compelling presentation layers.

When hosting your apps on the ChiselStrike platform, we'll handle all scaling, upgrade, and data layer work.  This ends any "devops", 
cloud architectures, scaling, monitoring, automation, or security concerns.

Some examples:

* Do you need a simple CRUD application that just allows you to POST to and GET from multiple endpoints? We've got you covered!
* Want to run some complex business logic in the API layer? No problem, it's fully customizable!
* Want to connect to other microservices? A bit more Typescript and... done!
* Need to protect confidential data and ensure consistent security? Our policy language will make this incredibly simple.

When you're ready to move into production, the Chiselstrike hosted service deploys your applications directly from your GitHub repositories.
Interested? The service itself is currently in a private beta. You can join by contacting us at

For development, you can install ChiselStrike locally, allowing for easy local development and testing, and is a great way
to try out all of the features, and it works 100% offline!  When  you're done, host the backend on our platform, and
use your favorite platform to deliver the frontend.

ChiselStrike integrates easily with Gatsby, Next.js, or any of your favorite frameworks.

Throughout the next chapters, we'll show you how.
