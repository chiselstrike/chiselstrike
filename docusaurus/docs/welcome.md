# Welcome to ChiselStrike!

We're so happy you're here!

And since you're here, you have certainly heard of ChiselStrike, but may still be wondering what
ChiselStrike is.

In a few short words, ChiselStrike allows you - yes, you - to have your entire persistence layer
(database, APIs, authentication) created for you from your Typescript definitions. You bring
your Typescript knowledge and we'll get the rest done. Your very own backend, *chiseled* just
for you, that evolves with your needs.

* Need a simple CRUD application that just allows you to POST to and GET from an endpoint? Boom, we've got you covered.
* Want to run some complex business logic in the API layer, federate and connect to other microservices? A bit more Typescript and... done!
* Access policies and user authentication are your thing? No problem!

All of that is avaialable as a service and created straight from your Github code.
Interested? The service itself is in private beta. You can join by contacting us at
https://forms.gle/cwMghfrXz1ZPiWKK6

However, for development purposes, you can install ChiselStrike locally and try it on your laptop.
It works totally offline, and you can integrate it with Gatsby, Next.js, or your favorite framework.
Your entire test application, from the UI to the backend, totally offline??? how cool is that!! ðŸ¤©
 
And that, my friend, you can do right now! Throughout the next chapters, we'll show you how.
