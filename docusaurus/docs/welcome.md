# Welcome to ChiselStrike!

Before we begin, consider joining our Discord community: https://discord.gg/GHNN9CNAZe

It's a pleasure to have you as part of our private beta. Although
ChiselStrike is in early stages, we hope you will already find it very
useful for a variety of your use cases.

The goal of this private beta is to make sure we're building the right experience
for you. Throughout this documentation, you will learn how to install ChiselStrike
from npm and should have all that you need to build a backend locally in your laptop,
totally even works totally offline (how cool is that!! ðŸ¤©). You can integrate it with Gatsby,
Next.js, or any other framework.

Over the next few weeks, after the first round of feedback, we'll also allow you to deploy  
it directly in our infrastructure from your git repository (and don't worry about ðŸ’°, it's 
on us!)
