# Gatsby Blog

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) is a React-based static-site generator, among other things.

We have an early example of a blog built on Gatsby here.  Gatsby generates the blog posts and we use
ChiselStrike to add dynamic comments.

This example will be updated over time to show off more and more features.
